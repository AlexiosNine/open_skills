Anthropic recently announced Skills for Claude - reusable folders with instructions, scripts, and resources that make Claude better at specialized tasks. This tool lets you run these skills entirely on your local machine in a sandboxed environment.

What this means: You can now process your files (documents, spreadsheets, presentations, images) using these specialized skills while keeping all data on your Mac. No uploads, complete privacy.

This tool executes AI-generated code in a truly isolated sandboxed environment on your Mac using Apple's native containers.
